# Pathfinding-Application
Developed a pathfinding application/tool for navigation across the University of Washington campus.
This project was undertaken as part of the CSE 331 (Software Design and Implementation) course, spanning from October 2022 to December 2022. 
The application employs a combination of Java for the backend, the Spark framework for server functionality, 
and React for the frontend.
