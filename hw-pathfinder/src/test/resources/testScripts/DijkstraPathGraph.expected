# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# src and dest node are the same.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph
added node E to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 50.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 8.000 from D to E in simpleGraph

path from A to E:
A to B with weight 10.000
B to C with weight 1.000
C to D with weight 50.000
D to E with weight 8.000
total cost: 69.000
