# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# src and dest node are the same.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 50.000 from A to A in simpleGraph

path from A to A:
