# Test edges with 2 + self loop edges but with different labels


# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes A
added node A to graph1

# add an edge from A -> A (e1), A -> A (e2) and A -> A (e3)
added edge e1 from A to A in graph1
added edge e2 from A to A in graph1
added edge e3 from A to A in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges for src nodes to dest nodes
graph1 contains: A
the children of A in graph1 are: A(e1) A(e2) A(e3)

# Add a duplicate edge from A to A with label
added edge e1 from A to A in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges for src nodes to dest nodes
#Duplicate edges shouldn't modify the graph
graph1 contains: A
the children of A in graph1 are: A(e1) A(e2) A(e3)
