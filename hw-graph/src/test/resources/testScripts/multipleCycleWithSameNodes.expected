# Test cases when you can have multiple cycles with the same number of nodes
# Tests multiple cycles with 4 nodes in the graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes A, B, C and D
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1
added node C to graph1
added node D to graph1

# Add an edges between the nodes A, B, C, D
added edge e1 from A to B in graph1
added edge e2 from A to B in graph1
added edge e3 from B to C in graph1
added edge e4 from C to D in graph1
added edge e5 from D to A in graph1
added edge e6 from D to A in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges for src nodes to dest nodes
graph1 contains: A B C D
the children of A in graph1 are: B(e1) B(e2)
the children of B in graph1 are: C(e3)
the children of C in graph1 are: D(e4)
the children of D in graph1 are: A(e5) A(e6)
