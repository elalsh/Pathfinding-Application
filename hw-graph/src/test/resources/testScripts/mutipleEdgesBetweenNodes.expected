# Tests 2 nodes with multiple edges  but with different labels

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes A
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1

# Add an edges to the graph
added edge e1 from A to B in graph1
added edge e2 from A to B in graph1
added edge e3 from A to B in graph1
added edge e4 from B to A in graph1
added edge e5 from B to A in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges for src nodes to dest nodes
graph1 contains: A B
the children of A in graph1 are: B(e1) B(e2) B(e3)
the children of B in graph1 are: A(e4) A(e5)
