# The expected number of edges should stay the same since the edge added is duplicate

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes A, B, C and D
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1
added node C to graph1
added node D to graph1

# add an edge from A -> B and C -> D
added edge edgeAB from A to B in graph1
added edge edgeCD from C to D in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges for src nodes
graph1 contains: A B C D
the children of A in graph1 are: B(edgeAB)
the children of C in graph1 are: D(edgeCD)

# Add a duplicate edge into the graph
added edge edgeAB from A to B in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph after adding the duplicate edge
graph1 contains: A B C D
the children of A in graph1 are: B(edgeAB)
the children of C in graph1 are: D(edgeCD)
