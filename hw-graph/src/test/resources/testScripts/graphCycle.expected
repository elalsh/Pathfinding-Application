# Tests a cycle with 4 nodes in the graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes A, B, C and D
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1
added node C to graph1
added node D to graph1

# add an edges to the Graph
added edge e1 from A to B in graph1
added edge e2 from B to C in graph1
added edge e3 from C to D in graph1
added edge e4 from D to A in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from A, B, C, D
graph1 contains: A B C D
the children of A in graph1 are: B(e1)
the children of B in graph1 are: C(e2)
the children of C in graph1 are: D(e3)
the children of D in graph1 are: A(e4)
