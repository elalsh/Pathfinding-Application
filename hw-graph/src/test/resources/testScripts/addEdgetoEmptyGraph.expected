# Tests adding a an a single directed edge to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge edgeAB from A to B in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: A B
the children of A in graph1 are: B(edgeAB)
